## 1. General

This is the nHentai downloader I wrote to archive as much of the [english nHentai library](https://nhentai.net/language/english/popular) as I can. That's why from the beginning it has been designed with big data sizes in mind and, for example, uses multithreaded downloads to download more than 1 image at once. Still, I wanted to keep it as simple code-wise and as easy to use as I can; hope I succeeded with that.  
Big thanks go out to [h3nTa1m4st3r_xx69](https://github.com/sam-k0), who helped me using nhentai's completely undocumented API. Without him this project could not have been reactivated.  
I'm happy about anyone who finds my software useful and feedback is also always welcome. Happy downloading~
